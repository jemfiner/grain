# grain

the beginning of a grain instrument . . .
right now there are two buffers, one for live recirding (1) and one for samples (2)
currently they won't play simultaneously

--  load sample into buffer 2 (via parameters) or record into buffer 1
--  key 2: toggles record
--  key 3: starts play
--  enc 2: incremnt size
--  enc 3: scale select for pitch dispersion (set in parameters)

many things to do !
using scales for pitch dispersion can work well but also often too many notes . . .
